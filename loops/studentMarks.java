/* Make a menu driven program. The user can enter 2 numbers, either 1 or 0. 
If the user enters 1 then keep taking input from the user for a studentâ€™s marks(out of 100). 
If they enter 0 then stop.
If he/ she scores :
Marks >=90 -> print (This is Good)
89 >= Marks >= 60 -> print (This is also Good)
59 >= Marks >= 0 -> print (This is Good as well)
	Because marks do not matter but our effort does.
(Hint : use do-while loop but think & understand why)
